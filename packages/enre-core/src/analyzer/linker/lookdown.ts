/**
 * Concept: Symbol & Entity
 *
 * An **Entity** is a declaration element in the source code, ENRE sees all entities and
 * its belonging relations (parent/children) as the skeleton of code.
 *
 * Entity may not necessarily be named code elements (variable, named function, etc.),
 * but also unnamed code elements (anonymous function, arrow function, etc.).
 *
 * All ENRERelations are and should start from an ENREEntity and end at an ENREEntity.
 *
 * However, entity along is not sufficient for describing all code behaviors. Thus,
 * introducing the concept of **Symbol**:
 *
 * A **symbol** has relevance to the modeling of internal object mechanism representation.
 *
 * Symbols are all named, representing what a developer could refer to and use in the code.
 *
 * Both entity and symbol share the same storage system, that is, ENREEntity. However, in
 * different context, the same ENREEntity can be interpreted as an entity or a symbol.
 *
 * (THIS IS INDEED CONFUSING, DEFINITELY NEEDS A BETTER DESIGN, FOR NOW JUST FOLLOW IT.)
 *
 * For example, given the following function declaration:
 *
 * ```js
 * function foo() { console.log('foo') }
 * foo = () => { console.log('bar') }
 * ```
 *
 * while visiting the FunctionDeclaration AST node, ENRE creates an ENREEntity <entity>
 * with `.name=foo` to represent the fact that a new name `foo` is declared in the scope.
 * In this context, the <entity> serves as a symbol, and only its name matters.
 *
 * ENRE also creates a JSObjRepr <objRepr> that `.callable[0].entity=<entity>` to reflect
 * the fact of `function xxx() {}` that creates a callable (function). Notice that ENRE
 * reuse the <entity> as the <objRepr>'s callable. In this context, <entity> serves as an
 * entity, and it is its type (=function) matters. ENRE also set
 * `<entity>.pointsTo[0]=<objRepr>` to bind the name `foo` with the callable element.
 *
 * In line 2, ENRE creates another ENREEntity <entity2> where `.name=<Anon>` and
 * `.type=function` as well as <objRepr2>, and append <objRepr2> to <entity>.pointsTo to
 * reflect the fact that the symbol `foo` is assigned to a new callable element.
 *
 * (ENRE CURRENTLY IS PATH-INSENSITIVE, AFTER <entity2> IS CREATED, <entity> SHOULD NO
 * LONGER BE ACTIVATED. HOWEVER, THIS FEATURE IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.)
 *
 * The data structure graph is as following:
 *
 * ENREEntityStorage (@enre-ts/data.eGraph)
 * |- <entity>
 * |  |- pointsTo
 * |  |  |- 0: <objRepr>
 * |  |  |     |- callable
 * |  |  |     |  |- 0: (.entity) <entity>
 * |  |  |- 1: <objRepr2>
 * |  |  |     |- callable
 * |  |  |     |  |- 0: (.entity) <entity2>
 * |- <entity2>
 * |  |- pointsTo
 * |  |  |- 0: <objRepr2>
 * |  |  |     |- callable
 * |  |  |     |  |- 0: (.entity) <entity2>
 *
 * So given the concept model as described above, if a call to symbol `foo` is met, the
 * following procedure will be executed:
 *
 * 1. Find the symbol `foo` recursively in the scope until the root scope is reached.
 *    (In this example, `foo` can be found, thus omit exception handling.)
 *
 * 2. (1) returns an ENREEntity <entity>, however it should be interpreted as a symbol.
 *    (THOUGH AN ENREEntity IS RETURNED, THE PROCEDURE CANNOT BE STOPPED HERE.)
 *
 * 3. Given the code context is a call expression, ENRE enumerate <entity>'s all pointsTo
 *    and visit all callables.
 *
 * 4. (3) visits <objRepr> and <objRepr2>, and returns <entity> and <entity2>, which
 *    should be interpreted as entity.
 *
 * 5. Bind the call relation, `from` is upper scope entity, `to` is <entity> and <entity2>
 *    respectively as explained in (4).
