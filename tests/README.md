All **FILES** and **DIRECTORIES** whose name start with an underline char `_` are auto-generated by extracting from
corresponding doc files, **DO NOT EDIT THEM**.

To add test cases that are not expected to be in docs, you should manually create the group directories and case
directories whose name start with no `_` and other parts are identical as what would generate by the program.
