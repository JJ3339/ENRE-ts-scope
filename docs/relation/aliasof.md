## Relation: AliasOf

An `AliasOf Relation` establishes a link between an `Alias Entity` and any other
export-able entities.

### Supported Patterns

```yaml
name: Relation aliasof
freeform: true
```

> See [the export relation page](../relation/export.md)
> and [the import relation page](../relation/import.md).
